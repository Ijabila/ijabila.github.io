Independent territory? Is it even on planet Earth? Not sure? Well you’ve come to the right place to get all the information you need to know about Baku.</p>

            <p>Well, first off, Baku isn’t really a country, it’s the capital of the country Azerbaijan which is located around the Western coast of Asia and shares borders with Turkey, Iran, Georgia, Armenia and Russia, from where it gained its independence in 1991.</p>

            <p>With a population of just over 10,000,000 with just under 83,000 square kilometres of land and about 4,000 square kilometres of water, it is ranked the 113th largest nation in the world by land and water mass and 91st by population. 
            The official currency of Azerbaijan is the Azerbaijani Manat and people from Azerbaijan are referred to as Azerbaijani, so that gives you 114 Azerbaijanis per square kilometre.</p>
            
            <p>Now to Baku, which is sometimes referred to as the princess city of Paris and Dubai. Baku is the capital city of Azerbaijan and undoubtedly one of the most beautiful cities in the world. One of the biggest cities in the country with a population of 1.1 million people, it holds  the ‘Old City’, a UNESCO world heritage site.</p>

            <p>Baku is one city you will definitely find interesting, not only for it’s beautiful environs and marble and stone plated walls,but for the artfully crafted streets and soothing breeze.</p>

            <p>One site to visit in Baku is the Gobustan National Park which is the other UNESCO heritage site in the country. In Azerbaijan alone, there are well over 300 mud volcanoes of which may are found in the Gobustan National Park and which account for about 30% of the world’s total.</p>
